# MAKiTChess 0.9.2
---
This script is still WiP, the documentation will be available soon.

# Usage:
For now, in order to compile the code. You can use the ```build.ps1```, I would personally recommend using the ```-fast```, because it shouldn't be causing any bugs and it is making it significantly better for the AI.

>In order to compile enter the folder ***MAKITCHESS*** *(the file that everything is in)* and only then execute the build.ps1, otherwise the textures won't load.
